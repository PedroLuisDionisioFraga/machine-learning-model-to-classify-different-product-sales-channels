# Best Model Selection

## Decision Tree (Chosen Model)
Advantages:
1. **Simple to Understand and Interpret**: Decision Trees are easy to visualize and explain. Their structure resembles a flowchart, making them intuitive for interpreting decision rules.
2. **Handles Both Numerical and Categorical Data**: They can manage different types of data without requiring much preprocessing.
3. **Performs Well on Small Datasets**: They can produce good results even with relatively small amounts of data.

Disadvantages:
1. **Prone to Overfitting**: Decision Trees can easily become too complex and overfit the training data, leading to poor performance on unseen data.
2. **Sensitive to Small Data Changes**: A slight change in the data can result in a completely different tree being generated, making the model unstable.
3. **Less Effective for Complex Problems**: For problems requiring complex decision boundaries, Decision Trees may perform worse compared to other algorithms like Random Forests or Neural Networks.

Why Decision Tree was chosen:
1. Computational efficiency.
2. Ability to handle different types of data.
3. Capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

## k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Advantages:
1. **Simple to Implement**: k-NN is an easy-to-understand algorithm that requires no explicit training phase, making it straightforward to implement.
2. **No Assumptions About Data Distribution**: k-NN is non-parametric and does not assume any underlying distribution of the data.
3. **Adaptable to New Data**: It can easily incorporate new data points without the need to retrain the model.

Disadvantages:
1. **Computationally Intensive**: k-NN can be slow with large datasets since it requires calculating the distance between the test point and every other point in the dataset.
2. **Sensitive to Irrelevant Features**: If the dataset contains irrelevant or noisy features, k-NN’s performance can degrade significantly.
3. **Storage Requirements**: Since k-NN keeps all the training data in memory, it requires significant storage and can be impractical with very large datasets.

## Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Advantages:
1. **Capable of Capturing Complex Patterns**: MLPs are capable of learning non-linear relationships, making them suitable for complex problems.
2. **Flexible Architecture**: MLPs can be adapted by adjusting the number of layers and neurons, allowing for flexibility in solving different problems.
3. **Good for Continuous and Discrete Data**: MLPs can handle both types of data, making them versatile across different applications.

Disadvantages:
1. **Requires Extensive Training Time**: MLPs typically need a significant amount of time and computational power to train, especially with large datasets.
2. **Prone to Overfitting**: Without proper regularization, MLPs can easily overfit the training data, especially when the network is too large.
3. **Needs Extensive Hyperparameter Tuning**: The performance of MLPs depends heavily on the correct tuning of hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, and neurons, making them more complex to optimize.

## Naïve Bayes
Advantages:
1. **Simple and Fast**: Naïve Bayes is a straightforward algorithm that is computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications.
2. **Works Well with Small Datasets**: Despite its simplicity, Naïve Bayes can perform surprisingly well with small amounts of data.
3. **Performs Well with High-Dimensional Data**: It’s effective in handling high-dimensional datasets, especially in text classification problems.

Disadvantages:
1. **Strong Assumptions About Feature Independence**: The algorithm assumes that all features are independent, which is rarely the case in real-world data, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.
2. **Not Suitable for Complex Relationships**: Naïve Bayes struggles with complex or highly interrelated features since it does not capture feature interactions.
3. **Limited to Simple Decision Boundaries**: Naïve Bayes is not well-suited for problems requiring complex decision boundaries, as it assumes linear decision boundaries between classes.(Computational Cost)
